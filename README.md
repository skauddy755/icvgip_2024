# Why make notes and later compile them?

I agree that most of the concepts touched upon during the sessions can be better read later from the original research papers or even youtube. However, it is important that someone takes notes of:
1. What are the contents of the topic (so that it can be later searched)
2. What is the context in which these topics have been mentioned
3. There is a vast ocean of literature available, but I was interested to know that how academia and others from the industry look upon the various topics.
4. No matter how attentive I was during the sessions, a week later I would either forget most of the concepts, or remember a distorted version of the concepts (which is worse)

> **DISCLAIMER:** 
> 1. The notes were made only for tutorials, and planery talks. Since in my view paper presenters could do a good job explaining the central concepts (owing to lack of sufficient time, as each paper was given only 7 minutes) 
> 2. Even for tutorials and planery talks, I have taken notes of only the topics which seemed interesting and relevant to my field.
> 3. I only capture the central idea and reference papers which were discussed during the sessions. 

# Contents and overall structure of the 3 Day Conference
